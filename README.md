#### Brief Description of your Solution - 

    Environmental pollution caused by human activities is a major global issue that poses significant threats to the planet's health and sustainability. Human activities, such as industrialization, transportation, agriculture, and urbanization, have led to the release of harmful pollutants into the air, water, and soil, causing adverse impacts on human health, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.
    Because of that reason, measuring day-by-day environmental health has become the most important thing. Through this project, we are planning to develop an IOT device that is capable to identify the healthiness of the environment and do predictions of future environmental health. The proposed system has planned to develop using an Arduino UNO microcontroller with a DHT11 temperature sensor to gather the measures of temperature and humidity of the current environment, and an LCD display to print the current condition of the environment. Based on the inputs of the temperature sensor system calculates the heat index. Using that calculated heat index it identifies the relevant heat index range and displays the condition of the environment as Caution, Extreme, Danger, or Extreme Danger.
    In addition to that gathered data send into cloud infrastructure through the MQTT broker. The information that was obtained from the sensor will be shown in the NODE-RED dashboard. The dashboard will display current data and historical data. With historical information, it is possible to make a prediction about the temperature and humidity for the coming year. Hence, the user will be able to view how the temperature and humidity have changed over time and how the temperature and humidity will be in the future by using the system dashboard.
